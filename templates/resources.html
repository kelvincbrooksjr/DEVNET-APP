        <h1>Resources</h1>
        <h3>Cisco DevNet Info</h3>
        <p> A lot of the information I used for obtaining my DevNet Associate came from
            https://developer.cisco.com/  The rest came for Pluralsight, courses by
            Nick Russo, and CBT Nuggets, courses by Knox Hutchinson and Ben Finkel.

            The DevNet sight contains many sandboxes for free pratice.  Here is a list
            of tools and programs I recommend you install to use to practice fully: Python,
            Docker, VirtualBox/VMWare or WSL2 if on Windows (Some things work more consistently in Linux),
            Postman, VS Code or Sublime Text, and Git Bash (once again, if using Windows).
        </p>
        <h3>AWS Solutions Architect Associate</h3>
        <p> A lot of the information I used for obtaining my AWSCSAA came from FreeCodeCamp.
            There is a video by Andrew Brown which is amazing.  Other great resources I used
            include: Pluralsight, CBT Nuggets, and Amazon's free training material.  It is
            extremely easy to start up an AWS account.  AWS offers numerous resources that are
            "free tier".  Note: free tier will not be production level for a mid-size company or
            larger.  However, it's perfect for getting your hands dirty and getting intimate with
            many common services which is paramount for success on the examination.
        </p>
        <h3> Juniper Certs are free</h3>
        <p> As of right now Juniper associate level certifications can be free.

            There are 5 Juniper associate level certifications: JNICA-Junos, JNCIA-Sec,
            JNCIA-Cloud, JNCIA-DevOps, and JNCDA (Design).

            You can look into this be going to https://learningportal.juniper.net/

            So far, I have studied for and acheived the JNICA-Junos cert.  The information
            on Juniper's site is ample. Their practice tests are great.  After taking the training
            there is a voucher examination, passing the voucher exam will result in being
            sent a voucher to take the examination for free.
